This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

React + TypeScript learning project.

Task:
Create a board of n x m tiles on a web page. Each tile on the board will start as white, but when clicked will toggle between a generated random color and returning to white. Each time a tile is toggled to a random color it should generate a new random color value.

Include a button so that users can clear (set all tiles to white) on their board.

And additionally include a save button that will extract the state of the board as a JSON object

Instructions:

  Use any languages, frameworks, or 3rd party libraries as you see fit.
  Get as far as you can through the challenge starting with the front-end experience of rendering and user interaction of the board.

Bonus:

  Include a function to load the board from a saved state.
